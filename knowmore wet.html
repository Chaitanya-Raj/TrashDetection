                                              Wet waste (such as food scraps or cooking oils) is biodegradable. Recycling diverts food waste from landfill and turns it into compost.<br>

                                              Restaurants, factories and building sites all need efficient wet waste solutions. Many of them rely on URM to help their business run smoothly.<br>
                                              
                                              URM accepts the following wet waste materials:<br>
                                              
                                              Organic food matter<br>
                                              Cooking fats<br>
                                              Oil<br>
                                              Grease<br>
                                              Hazardous waste<br>
                                              Other liquid waste produced as a by-product.<br>
                                              URM employees follow Workplace Health and Safety laws at all times to ensure your protection.<br>
                                              
                                              Did you know?<br><br>
                                              
                                              In Australia, around 4 tonnes of food ends up in landfill each year. As food waste decomposes it releases harmful gases. By segregating office and household waste, you reduce your carbon footprint.<br>
