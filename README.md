### Improvising the waste management system

__Context:__ 

_Clean India is one of the finest programs that has raised awareness among people to keep our environment clean. For the same reason, Govt. of India has put dustbins in public places and has segregated them into green and blue dustbins for a different type of waste. But as it has been observed that people really donâ€™t seem to care to differentiate between the two. That is the reason there is a lot of manual work in waste management._

__Hack:__

_The hack is to make an intelligent system that can monitor real-time movement of garbage trucks from bins to finally the dumping yard. The system is programmed such that it can even record if a bin has been missed during the operations. It should also have access to real-time locations of all trucks so that if some trucks are not completely filled then they can meet at a certain checkpoint and collect the garbage in lesser number of trucks._

### _OUR Pitch:_
Imagine buying a cup of coffee from your favorite cafe or ordering a burger form your favorite outlet. While you enjoy your coffee and burger, think of what you'll do with the wrappers and throw-away cup they came in. Will you discard them in the blue or the green bin? Worry not, while you were enjoying your cup of coffee, we made something to help you with this choice. When you'll get near the dustbin, you'll be greeted by our program running on an iPad or a tablet installed on the wall in front of you. the screen will be split in two parts, one showing dry waste and the second wet waste. Just hold your cup and wrapper in front of screen and our program will tell you which one should go in which bin. once you have placed the garbage in the correct bin, our app will give you information about when the garbage truck will take the garbage away, how far the garbage truck is and it's live location. Alongside that, it will also show you the recycling process for for your trash and some interesting facts on the current garbage situation and what would have happened if you had not thrown away the waste correctly.  
Our "Jugaad" was to implement a cache each time a new piece of garbage is shown to reduce latency in search results.
