### Improvising the waste management system

__Context:__ 

_Clean India is one of the finest programs that has raised awareness among people to keep our environment clean. For the same reason, Govt. of India has put dustbins in public places and has segregated them into green and blue dustbins for a different type of waste. But as it has been observed that people really donâ€™t seem to care to differentiate between the two. That is the reason there is a lot of manual work in waste management._

__Hack:__

_The hack is to make an intelligent system that can monitor real-time movement of garbage trucks from bins to finally the dumping yard. The system is programmed such that it can even record if a bin has been missed during the operations. It should also have access to real-time locations of all trucks so that if some trucks are not completely filled then they can meet at a certain checkpoint and collect the garbage in lesser number of trucks._
